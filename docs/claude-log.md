# Claude session log

Handoff notes between AI sessions ("harnesses"). Newest entry first.

**Why this exists:** a session ends with claims in its chat transcript and nothing
in the repo. The next session starts blind, re-derives what the last one already
worked out, and — worse — inherits assertions it has no way to check. This file
carries the claims forward *with their evidence*, so the next session knows what
was measured and what was merely asserted.

## How to use it

Every session that changes anything in this repo appends an entry before it
finishes. See `CLAUDE.md` for when that is required.

Each entry separates three things, and the separation is the point:

- **Verified** — checked this session, with the check named. A number with no
  stated method is not verified.
- **Claimed, unverified** — stated in the session but not actually confirmed,
  or confirmed only by weak evidence. Say what would settle it. Anything here is
  a lead, not a fact; do not build on it without checking first.
- **Open** — known to be wrong or incomplete, and not fixed.

Durable issues also belong in `docs/risk-register.md`. That file is the standing
issue list; this one is the narrative of who checked what, when. When an entry
here names a lasting problem, add it there too and say so.

Correcting an earlier entry is expected and welcome. Do not edit the old entry:
add a new one that says what was wrong. The record of a mistaken claim is more
useful than a tidy file.

## 2026-09-25 — Week 3 source refresh: USA Today ingested; multi-week scoping fixed; CBS Week 3 not published

Task: Jeremy's Week 3 source-data refresh (commit+push pre-authorized).
Worktree: clean detached `~/workspace/fantasy-tools-refresh` at `5f89fc2`
(original `~/workspace/fantasy-tools` checkout was dirty/diverged — left
untouched). HTTPS git works; SSH blocked by environment.

### Verified

- **USA Today Week 3 ingested to live Supabase** (`pipelines/save_usatoday_references.py`):
  article dated 2026-09-23, 238 source rows (QB 36 / RB 59 / WR 106 / TE 37),
  702 table rows (234 players × 3 scorings), bake `usatwk3_2026-09-25_v1`,
  verified via Supabase count query (week=3, variant=as_published). Week 2
  rows (714, 2026-09-15) retained in the table.
- **USA Today upsert grain fix**: first ingest 400'd — code's conflict spec
  used `player_key` but the live `source_trade_values_grain` is
  `(source, player_norm, scoring, league_teams, qb_slots, season, week,
  variant)`. `USAT_UPSERT_CONFLICT` now uses `player_norm`; rows still carry
  numeric `player_key`. `test_rows_land_with_correct_grain` updated to assert
  `player_norm` in / `player_key` not in the conflict (negative guard).
- **CBS Week 3 does not exist yet** (checked 2026-09-25): the expected Week 3
  slug 404s with no TableBuilder markup; Dave Richard's author profile still
  lists Week 2 as latest; web search found no current CBS Week 3 trade chart.
  Never promoted stale Week 2 as Week 3.
- **Multi-week scoping defect fixed** (would have blocked the refresh):
  `import_supabase_references.py` + `verify_import_health.py` queried ALL
  historical rows per source; with USA Today now holding weeks 2+3,
  `derive_db_vintage()` fails closed on the mixed history and the health
  gate's unscoped re-query would TABLE_DRIFT on retained older weeks. Fix:
  `_select_latest_week()` / `_select_latest_snapshot_date()` scope reads to
  the latest complete vintage deterministically (never blended); the manifest
  records the scoping and `week_designated` (fallback to scoped week for dated
  sources); the health gate scopes its table re-query with `week=eq.N` /
  `espn_snapshot_date=eq.DATE`. `derive_db_vintage()` / `table_vintage()`
  themselves were NOT weakened — direct unit tests prove they still fail
  closed on multi-week/multi-date rows. Mixed dates *within* the selected
  week still fail closed. New tests: latest-wins for CBS/ESPN/Week-3-USA
  Today, no-blend, health-scopes-OK, health-still-catches-within-week-drift.
- **Full suite green**: 356 unittest tests pass (`python3 -m unittest
  discover -s tests`).
- Source state in live Supabase (2026-09-25): fantasycalc max week 2;
  fantasypros max week 2; usatoday max week 3 (702 rows); cbs_trade_values
  max week 2; espn_season_projections now 349 rows at vintage 2026-09-25
  (saved this session). FantasyCalc cache manifest is fresh Week 3
  (2026-09-23) but Supabase rows are still bake `fitwk2_2026-09-17_v3`.
- **ESPN orphan rows**: the 2026-09-25 save failed closed at first — the
  table held 355 rows at the (2026, week 2) grain vs 349 expected. Six
  players (Dart, Njoku, Jonathon Brooks, Tracy, Bagent, Manhertz) were
  eligible on 9/21 but are `eligible=False`/0.00 in the 9/25 pull, so the
  pipeline correctly routed them to review and left their old rows orphaned.
  Deleted the six superseded 2026-09-21 rows; re-ran the save; count check
  green (349 rows, all 2026-09-25). Upsert is idempotent, so if a player
  regains eligibility a later pull re-inserts him.
- **FantasyCalc Week 3 saved** (2026-09-25): no saver script existed (Week 2
  was an ad-hoc load), so wrote `pipelines/save_fantasycalc_references.py`
  following the USA Today pattern — 591 as_published rows, bake
  `fcwk3_2026-09-25_v1`, native_value=raw API value, value=isotonic-reindexed
  chart scale. 12 review rows: Kenny Gainwell (no canonical identity —
  "Kenny" vs fixture's "Kenneth") and Carson Wentz (has player_key but not
  in the comparison fixture's universe, so no ESPN anchor for the reindex).
  **as_published only**: the bias_adjusted variant is a derived calibration
  whose fit target (Monday reassessed methodology leg) is stale in-season —
  re-fitting now would be dishonest, and the importer never consumes
  bias_adjusted. Regression tests added (SaveFantasycalcTest, 4 tests);
  full suite 360/360 green.
- **Import health is RED (2026-09-25 22:17 UTC)** — 3 ok / 2 stale / 0 missing:
  ok: fantasycalc (591 rows, Week 3), usatoday (702 rows, 2026-09-23),
  espn (349 rows, 2026-09-25).
  STALE: fantasypros (534 rows, vintage 2026-09-15 = Week 2 — no Week 3
  trade-chart source file exists); cbs (372 rows, Week 2 — Week 3 article
  not published/found despite discovery + web search + author-profile check).
  Per the hard gate, the match/reference/section/reindex/review/promote
  chain, fixture rebuild, and make validate are BLOCKED until both sources
  have genuine Week 3 data. Week 2 CBS was NOT promoted as Week 3.
- Snapshots stamped: data/raw/sources/{fantasycalc/week-3,usatoday/2026-09-23,
  fantasypros/2026-09-15,espn/2026-09-25,cbs/week-2}/snapshot.json.

### Claimed, unverified

- None this entry; CBS Week 3 absence is a negative web result, recheck before
  declaring the refresh complete.

### Open / next

- Save ESPN 2026-09-25 CSV → Supabase; run the Week 3 FantasyCalc save
  (cache manifest is fresh); FantasyPros Week 3 needs a genuine source file;
  CBS import stays Week 2 until CBS publishes Week 3.
- Then `make supabase-import` ×5 → `make import-health NFL_WEEK=3` →
  match/reference/section/reindex/review/promote → fixture rebuild →
  `make validate` → commit + push (authorized).
- `pipelines/save_espn_cbs_references.py` still hardcodes ESPN's designated
  table week and count query to week 2 — understand before saving/importing
  ESPN.

## 2026-09-25 — ESPN anchor priced from the built leg; clock-coupled tests

Commits: `cb4e921`, `0f1eccc`, `a297922`. Live build `tv-20260925-1449-a297922`
(Deploy dashboard #46).

### What changed

The ESPN curve was re-derived in the browser from raw per-game projections —
ppg minus a positional waiver line, scaled onto the positional pie. That is a
different valuation from the two-tier leg the pipeline builds: no softplus
glide, no slice pricing, and a bench assigned by surplus-over-baseline that gave
17 of 72 bench slots to quarterbacks in a 1QB league.

The published charts are isotonically reindexed onto the *pipeline* leg at build
time, so exactly one curve was off-shape while every positional pie total agreed
to a rounding error — which is why no existing guard fired. A total is blind to
shape.

`buildEspnIndexedMap` now reads `sources.espn.combos[...].values` in both
renderers. The browser-derived leg survives only as a fall-back below
`MIN_SHARED_FOR_PIE`, and still prices the raw value-above-waivers series and
the ESPN tier column. Related: the display bench share is measured off the
anchor rather than hardcoded to 0.15; the raw series is level-matched to the
anchor over the shared set; roster shaping totals over QB/RB/WR/TE only.

`a297922` is unrelated to the valuation — it fixes tests that pinned "now" to
the week they were written in. See below.

### Verified

Method in brackets. Full PPR / 12 teams unless stated.

- ESPN anchor positional peaks: QB 17.2, RB 81.8, WR 62.6, TE 27.9 — against
  12.5 / 99.1 / 63.0 / 17.3 before. [read `TradeValueCurveDiagnostics` on the
  live page after deploy #46]
- Published charts land at QB 17.3–18.0, RB 81.9–85.4, WR 59.2–63.4, TE
  26.1–28.9, all inside the agreement band. `sourceScaleAgreement: true`, 16
  positional comparisons, no offenders. [same]
- `fixedPieIndexed: true` and status "Validated" across all 12 scoring ×
  league-size combos. [headless Playwright sweep against the built `dist/`]
- Curve and player table agree at 81.8 for the top player — the two renderers
  had previously drifted (69.5 vs 76.5 on one page load). [headless run reading
  both the curve diagnostics and the rendered table]
- Four non-default roster shapes (WR 3→4, QB 1→2, FLEX 1→2, BENCH 6→8) hold both
  the pie check and the scale-agreement check. [headless, driving the roster
  controls]
- The new `sourceScaleAgreement` guard catches the defect it names: with the
  anchor forced back to the browser-derived leg, all four direct charts trip it
  (QB 1.31–1.39x, TE 1.46–1.61x). [simulated the broken state in a patched copy
  and confirmed the page refused to render]
- 342 tests pass, and the full suite passes under a faked clock at 2026-10-02,
  2026-11-15 and 2027-02-01. [`libfaketime`, ad-hoc harness — not wired into CI]
- Deploy #46 completed successfully; live build tag matches `a297922`. [GitHub
  Actions run list and the live page's `trade-chart-build` meta tag]

### Claimed, unverified

Read these as leads. Both were stated with more confidence than the evidence
supported.

- **"The CBS chart URL 404s."** My fetch of
  `sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fantasy/football/news/dave-richards-week-2-trade-chart-and-rest-of-season/`
  returned 404 — but the test fixtures fetch that same URL successfully on the
  Mac. The 404 was most likely this container's egress proxy, not a dead page.
  So the question of whether CBS published Bo Nix is **open, not answered**, and
  the reasoning that leaned on the 404 should be discarded. To settle it: open
  that URL from a normal browser and look at the QB table.
- **"The adjusted-series QB inflation lives in the stage-2 adjustment cells."**
  Inferred from the shape of the math — a per-position `alpha + beta * value`
  refit followed by one global renormalisation would leave a doubled QB doubled.
  I did not read the cell-baking pipeline. Verify before acting on it.
- Carried in from the prior session's summary, not re-checked here: the
  architecture/data-flow diagram is stale (weekly_signals was renamed
  weekly_vegas; Pages now serves three dashboards), and a backlog document was
  left partly written.

### Open

- **Adjusted series sit above the anchor's scale at QB.** FC Adjusted 26.6,
  USAT Adjusted 34.1, FP Adjusted 26.6, CBS Adjusted 30.4 against the anchor's
  17.2 — 1.5x to 2.0x. These four curves are ON by default and the hero copy
  promises one trade-value scale. Surfaced on the page as the non-blocking
  `adjusted-scale-agreement` chart-health warning. In the risk register. This is
  the largest remaining correctness problem on the chart.
- **Bo Nix is absent from CBS only** (present on the other four sources). CBS
  carries 124 players and 16 QBs. The fixture matches the promoted CBS reference
  exactly, so nothing is being dropped downstream — the question is what CBS
  published. In the risk register. Do not impute a value.
- **`make validate` rewrites tracked files.** It runs `make sync`, which stamps
  the build tag and `generated_at`/`today` into four files. A validate run
  therefore dirties the tree and makes the *next* `git merge --ff-only` abort —
  this cost a full failed deploy cycle on 2026-09-25 before anyone noticed the
  merge had aborted and validate had run against the old code. Workaround:
  `git checkout -- .` (or a fresh clone) before merging. Proposed fix, not done
  because it touches the publish path: make `sync` verify-only inside `validate`
  and keep stamping on the explicit publish path.
- **`espn-starter-markup` reads 1.048 against a 1.05 threshold.** Deliberately
  left; it describes the fall-back leg, which nothing renders while the built leg
  is present, so it warns rather than fails.

### Notes for the next session

- The 12-combo headless sweep is the required check before any chart change.
  Pie totals agreeing proves nothing about curve shape — that is exactly how the
  ESPN defect survived every guard for days.
- Pushing from a cloud container is blocked by the git proxy ("not in this
  session's authorized repository set"). The working path is: commit locally,
  `git bundle create`, write it to the Mac's `Claude outputs/` folder, and have
  the user fetch and push from a **fresh clone**. Adding the repo to the
  session's authorized sources would remove this step.
- `verify_live.py` cannot reach github.io from the container (egress). Use the
  in-app browser to read the live page instead.
