# Claude session log

Handoff notes between AI sessions ("harnesses"). Newest entry first.

**Why this exists:** a session ends with claims in its chat transcript and nothing
in the repo. The next session starts blind, re-derives what the last one already
worked out, and — worse — inherits assertions it has no way to check. This file
carries the claims forward *with their evidence*, so the next session knows what
was measured and what was merely asserted.

## How to use it

Every session that changes anything in this repo appends an entry before it
finishes. See `CLAUDE.md` for when that is required.

Each entry separates three things, and the separation is the point:

- **Verified** — checked this session, with the check named. A number with no
  stated method is not verified.
- **Claimed, unverified** — stated in the session but not actually confirmed,
  or confirmed only by weak evidence. Say what would settle it. Anything here is
  a lead, not a fact; do not build on it without checking first.
- **Open** — known to be wrong or incomplete, and not fixed.

Durable issues also belong in `docs/risk-register.md`. That file is the standing
issue list; this one is the narrative of who checked what, when. When an entry
here names a lasting problem, add it there too and say so.

Correcting an earlier entry is expected and welcome. Do not edit the old entry:
add a new one that says what was wrong. The record of a mistaken claim is more
useful than a tidy file.

## 2026-09-26 - Push policy updated for autonomous completion

### Verified

- Updated `CLAUDE.md` so repo sessions commit, push, wait for GitHub Actions,
  and verify the live site by default after clean validation when the user asks
  for a repo/site outcome. The literal words `Push` or `Publish` are no longer
  required.
- Aligned `docs/watchdog.md` with the new rule. Hard stops still apply for red
  validation, destructive history or force pushes, production Supabase writes or
  schema changes, credential/login actions, and non-inferable business-rule
  changes.

### Open

- No code-path validation needed; this was a docs/policy-only change.

## 2026-09-26 - Live adjusted labels corrected to Week 3

### Verified

- After the first push, the live GitHub Pages dashboard showed the adjusted curves enabled, but FC/USAT/FP adjusted still displayed `Wk 2 stale - waiting Wk 3` because their labels read stale baked `fit_bake_id` metadata.
- Updated the curve widget so live adjusted curves take their week label from the underlying live source metadata when adjustment cells are active. Local Playwright check against the static dashboard showed `FC Adjusted Wk 3`, `USAT Adjusted Wk 3`, `FP Adjusted Wk 3`, and `CBS Adjusted Wk 3`, all checked and enabled, with `adjustedOk=true` and no offenders.
- `make validate` passed locally after the label fix: 368 tests OK, 6 skipped.

## 2026-09-26 - Adjusted source curves unpaused and shape-guarded

### Verified

- Promoted `adjustment-inputs.json` and the versioned adjustment-input artifact from `pending-model-quality` to `live`; all four adjusted source toggles are enabled and checked in the default 12-team setups. Method: local Playwright browser matrix against the app asset.
- Replaced live adjusted global starter/bench normalization with `ValueModel.shapeToAnchorPeaksThenSharedTotal`, which aligns each position's peak to the ESPN adjusted anchor before shared-total scaling. The pre-fix forced-live run showed QB offenders at roughly 1.95x-2.09x; after the fix the browser matrix reported `adjustedOk=true` and no adjusted-scale offenders.
- For all 3 scoring x 4 team configs, browser diagnostics reported `sourceMapCoverage=true`, `fixedPieIndexed=true`, `sourceScaleAgreement=true`, and `adjustedOk=true`. Non-12 team configs keep adjusted toggles unavailable when matching source combos are absent; 12-team configs show all four adjusted curves by default.
- `make validate` passed locally: 368 tests OK, 6 skipped.

### Open

- `Health: 1 warn` remains from the known ESPN starter-markup ratio warning for the fallback leg; it is non-blocking and the rendered ESPN line uses the built leg.
- Changes are local worktree changes only; per `CLAUDE.md`, do not push or publish without explicit approval.

## 2026-09-25 — Week 3 source refresh: USA Today ingested; multi-week scoping fixed; CBS Week 3 not published

Task: Jeremy's Week 3 source-data refresh (commit+push pre-authorized).
Worktree: clean detached `~/workspace/fantasy-tools-refresh` at `5f89fc2`
(original `~/workspace/fantasy-tools` checkout was dirty/diverged — left
untouched). HTTPS git works; SSH blocked by environment.

### Verified

- **USA Today Week 3 ingested to live Supabase** (`pipelines/save_usatoday_references.py`):
  article dated 2026-09-23, 238 source rows (QB 36 / RB 59 / WR 106 / TE 37),
  702 table rows (234 players × 3 scorings), bake `usatwk3_2026-09-25_v1`,
  verified via Supabase count query (week=3, variant=as_published). Week 2
  rows (714, 2026-09-15) retained in the table.
- **USA Today upsert grain fix**: first ingest 400'd — code's conflict spec
  used `player_key` but the live `source_trade_values_grain` is
  `(source, player_norm, scoring, league_teams, qb_slots, season, week,
  variant)`. `USAT_UPSERT_CONFLICT` now uses `player_norm`; rows still carry
  numeric `player_key`. `test_rows_land_with_correct_grain` updated to assert
  `player_norm` in / `player_key` not in the conflict (negative guard).
- **CBS Week 3 does not exist yet** (checked 2026-09-25): the expected Week 3
  slug 404s with no TableBuilder markup; Dave Richard's author profile still
  lists Week 2 as latest; web search found no current CBS Week 3 trade chart.
  Never promoted stale Week 2 as Week 3.
- **Multi-week scoping defect fixed** (would have blocked the refresh):
  `import_supabase_references.py` + `verify_import_health.py` queried ALL
  historical rows per source; with USA Today now holding weeks 2+3,
  `derive_db_vintage()` fails closed on the mixed history and the health
  gate's unscoped re-query would TABLE_DRIFT on retained older weeks. Fix:
  `_select_latest_week()` / `_select_latest_snapshot_date()` scope reads to
  the latest complete vintage deterministically (never blended); the manifest
  records the scoping and `week_designated` (fallback to scoped week for dated
  sources); the health gate scopes its table re-query with `week=eq.N` /
  `espn_snapshot_date=eq.DATE`. `derive_db_vintage()` / `table_vintage()`
  themselves were NOT weakened — direct unit tests prove they still fail
  closed on multi-week/multi-date rows. Mixed dates *within* the selected
  week still fail closed. New tests: latest-wins for CBS/ESPN/Week-3-USA
  Today, no-blend, health-scopes-OK, health-still-catches-within-week-drift.
- **Full suite green**: 356 unittest tests pass (`python3 -m unittest
  discover -s tests`).
- Source state in live Supabase (2026-09-25): fantasycalc max week 2;
  fantasypros max week 2; usatoday max week 3 (702 rows); cbs_trade_values
  max week 2; espn_season_projections now 349 rows at vintage 2026-09-25
  (saved this session). FantasyCalc cache manifest is fresh Week 3
  (2026-09-23) but Supabase rows are still bake `fitwk2_2026-09-17_v3`.
- **ESPN orphan rows**: the 2026-09-25 save failed closed at first — the
  table held 355 rows at the (2026, week 2) grain vs 349 expected. Six
  players (Dart, Njoku, Jonathon Brooks, Tracy, Bagent, Manhertz) were
  eligible on 9/21 but are `eligible=False`/0.00 in the 9/25 pull, so the
  pipeline correctly routed them to review and left their old rows orphaned.
  Deleted the six superseded 2026-09-21 rows; re-ran the save; count check
  green (349 rows, all 2026-09-25). Upsert is idempotent, so if a player
  regains eligibility a later pull re-inserts him.
- **FantasyCalc Week 3 saved** (2026-09-25): no saver script existed (Week 2
  was an ad-hoc load), so wrote `pipelines/save_fantasycalc_references.py`
  following the USA Today pattern — 591 as_published rows, bake
  `fcwk3_2026-09-25_v1`, native_value=raw API value, value=isotonic-reindexed
  chart scale. 12 review rows: Kenny Gainwell (no canonical identity —
  "Kenny" vs fixture's "Kenneth") and Carson Wentz (has player_key but not
  in the comparison fixture's universe, so no ESPN anchor for the reindex).
  **as_published only**: the bias_adjusted variant is a derived calibration
  whose fit target (Monday reassessed methodology leg) is stale in-season —
  re-fitting now would be dishonest, and the importer never consumes
  bias_adjusted. Regression tests added (SaveFantasycalcTest, 4 tests);
  full suite 360/360 green.
- **Import health is RED (2026-09-25 22:17 UTC)** — 3 ok / 2 stale / 0 missing:
  ok: fantasycalc (591 rows, Week 3), usatoday (702 rows, 2026-09-23),
  espn (349 rows, 2026-09-25).
  STALE: fantasypros (534 rows, vintage 2026-09-15 = Week 2 — no Week 3
  trade-chart source file exists); cbs (372 rows, Week 2 — Week 3 article
  not published/found despite discovery + web search + author-profile check).
  Per the hard gate, the match/reference/section/reindex/review/promote
  chain, fixture rebuild, and make validate are BLOCKED until both sources
  have genuine Week 3 data. Week 2 CBS was NOT promoted as Week 3.
- Snapshots stamped: data/raw/sources/{fantasycalc/week-3,usatoday/2026-09-23,
  fantasypros/2026-09-15,espn/2026-09-25,cbs/week-2}/snapshot.json.
- **Pushed to main** (2026-09-25 ~22:20 UTC): commit `51092c60` (local
  `f9a63c1`, content-identical; SSH blocked so pushed via GitHub API —
  branch + fast-forward main + branch deleted). Deploy workflow
  "Deploy dashboard" completed success on the new SHA. The module monitor
  (modules/dashboard.html) redeploys with it.

### Claimed, unverified

- None this entry; CBS Week 3 absence is a negative web result, recheck before
  declaring the refresh complete.

### Open / next

- Save ESPN 2026-09-25 CSV → Supabase; run the Week 3 FantasyCalc save
  (cache manifest is fresh); FantasyPros Week 3 needs a genuine source file;
  CBS import stays Week 2 until CBS publishes Week 3.
- Then `make supabase-import` ×5 → `make import-health NFL_WEEK=3` →
  match/reference/section/reindex/review/promote → fixture rebuild →
  `make validate` → commit + push (authorized).
- `pipelines/save_espn_cbs_references.py` still hardcodes ESPN's designated
  table week and count query to week 2 — understand before saving/importing
  ESPN.

## 2026-09-25 — ESPN anchor priced from the built leg; clock-coupled tests

Commits: `cb4e921`, `0f1eccc`, `a297922`. Live build `tv-20260925-1449-a297922`
(Deploy dashboard #46).

### What changed

The ESPN curve was re-derived in the browser from raw per-game projections —
ppg minus a positional waiver line, scaled onto the positional pie. That is a
different valuation from the two-tier leg the pipeline builds: no softplus
glide, no slice pricing, and a bench assigned by surplus-over-baseline that gave
17 of 72 bench slots to quarterbacks in a 1QB league.

The published charts are isotonically reindexed onto the *pipeline* leg at build
time, so exactly one curve was off-shape while every positional pie total agreed
to a rounding error — which is why no existing guard fired. A total is blind to
shape.

`buildEspnIndexedMap` now reads `sources.espn.combos[...].values` in both
renderers. The browser-derived leg survives only as a fall-back below
`MIN_SHARED_FOR_PIE`, and still prices the raw value-above-waivers series and
the ESPN tier column. Related: the display bench share is measured off the
anchor rather than hardcoded to 0.15; the raw series is level-matched to the
anchor over the shared set; roster shaping totals over QB/RB/WR/TE only.

`a297922` is unrelated to the valuation — it fixes tests that pinned "now" to
the week they were written in. See below.

### Verified

Method in brackets. Full PPR / 12 teams unless stated.

- ESPN anchor positional peaks: QB 17.2, RB 81.8, WR 62.6, TE 27.9 — against
  12.5 / 99.1 / 63.0 / 17.3 before. [read `TradeValueCurveDiagnostics` on the
  live page after deploy #46]
- Published charts land at QB 17.3–18.0, RB 81.9–85.4, WR 59.2–63.4, TE
  26.1–28.9, all inside the agreement band. `sourceScaleAgreement: true`, 16
  positional comparisons, no offenders. [same]
- `fixedPieIndexed: true` and status "Validated" across all 12 scoring ×
  league-size combos. [headless Playwright sweep against the built `dist/`]
- Curve and player table agree at 81.8 for the top player — the two renderers
  had previously drifted (69.5 vs 76.5 on one page load). [headless run reading
  both the curve diagnostics and the rendered table]
- Four non-default roster shapes (WR 3→4, QB 1→2, FLEX 1→2, BENCH 6→8) hold both
  the pie check and the scale-agreement check. [headless, driving the roster
  controls]
- The new `sourceScaleAgreement` guard catches the defect it names: with the
  anchor forced back to the browser-derived leg, all four direct charts trip it
  (QB 1.31–1.39x, TE 1.46–1.61x). [simulated the broken state in a patched copy
  and confirmed the page refused to render]
- 342 tests pass, and the full suite passes under a faked clock at 2026-10-02,
  2026-11-15 and 2027-02-01. [`libfaketime`, ad-hoc harness — not wired into CI]
- Deploy #46 completed successfully; live build tag matches `a297922`. [GitHub
  Actions run list and the live page's `trade-chart-build` meta tag]

### Claimed, unverified

Read these as leads. Both were stated with more confidence than the evidence
supported.

- **"The CBS chart URL 404s."** My fetch of
  `sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fantasy/football/news/dave-richards-week-2-trade-chart-and-rest-of-season/`
  returned 404 — but the test fixtures fetch that same URL successfully on the
  Mac. The 404 was most likely this container's egress proxy, not a dead page.
  So the question of whether CBS published Bo Nix is **open, not answered**, and
  the reasoning that leaned on the 404 should be discarded. To settle it: open
  that URL from a normal browser and look at the QB table.
- **"The adjusted-series QB inflation lives in the stage-2 adjustment cells."**
  Inferred from the shape of the math — a per-position `alpha + beta * value`
  refit followed by one global renormalisation would leave a doubled QB doubled.
  I did not read the cell-baking pipeline. Verify before acting on it.
- Carried in from the prior session's summary, not re-checked here: the
  architecture/data-flow diagram is stale (weekly_signals was renamed
  weekly_vegas; Pages now serves three dashboards), and a backlog document was
  left partly written.

### Open

- **Adjusted series sit above the anchor's scale at QB.** FC Adjusted 26.6,
  USAT Adjusted 34.1, FP Adjusted 26.6, CBS Adjusted 30.4 against the anchor's
  17.2 — 1.5x to 2.0x. These four curves are ON by default and the hero copy
  promises one trade-value scale. Surfaced on the page as the non-blocking
  `adjusted-scale-agreement` chart-health warning. In the risk register. This is
  the largest remaining correctness problem on the chart.
- **Bo Nix is absent from CBS only** (present on the other four sources). CBS
  carries 124 players and 16 QBs. The fixture matches the promoted CBS reference
  exactly, so nothing is being dropped downstream — the question is what CBS
  published. In the risk register. Do not impute a value.
- **`make validate` rewrites tracked files.** It runs `make sync`, which stamps
  the build tag and `generated_at`/`today` into four files. A validate run
  therefore dirties the tree and makes the *next* `git merge --ff-only` abort —
  this cost a full failed deploy cycle on 2026-09-25 before anyone noticed the
  merge had aborted and validate had run against the old code. Workaround:
  `git checkout -- .` (or a fresh clone) before merging. Proposed fix, not done
  because it touches the publish path: make `sync` verify-only inside `validate`
  and keep stamping on the explicit publish path.
- **`espn-starter-markup` reads 1.048 against a 1.05 threshold.** Deliberately
  left; it describes the fall-back leg, which nothing renders while the built leg
  is present, so it warns rather than fails.

### Notes for the next session

- The 12-combo headless sweep is the required check before any chart change.
  Pie totals agreeing proves nothing about curve shape — that is exactly how the
  ESPN defect survived every guard for days.
- Pushing from a cloud container is blocked by the git proxy ("not in this
  session's authorized repository set"). The working path is: commit locally,
  `git bundle create`, write it to the Mac's `Claude outputs/` folder, and have
  the user fetch and push from a **fresh clone**. Adding the repo to the
  session's authorized sources would remove this step.
- `verify_live.py` cannot reach github.io from the container (egress). Use the
  in-app browser to read the live page instead.

## 2026-09-25 — Week 3 source refresh (all five sources)

Pulled Jeremy-supplied Week 3 URLs: CBS trade chart (138 players: 34 QB / 41 RB / 47 WR / 16 TE) and FantasyPros Week 3 chart (178 players, article date 2026-09-22). USA Today (238), FantasyCalc (591), ESPN (349) completed earlier in the day. `make import-health NFL_WEEK=3`: 5 ok / 0 stale / 0 missing / 0 failed. Match → reference → section → reindex → review → promote ran; `make validate`: 367 tests OK.

Defects found and fixed this session:
- **ESPN save grain hardcoded to week=2.** `save_espn_cbs_references.py` stamped every ESPN save as week 2, so the 2026-09-25 pull overwrote the genuine Week 2 rows with Week 3 content (ROS weeks 4-18), mislabeled. The genuine Week 2 ESPN snapshot is unrecoverable (daily CSVs overwritten; no archive). Repaired: week is now dynamic (`--week`, defaults to current NFL week); mislabeled week=2 rows deleted from `espn_season_projections`; 2026-09-25 data re-saved honestly as week 3 (349 rows). Regression tests in `test_cbs_usatoday_recurring.py::SaveEspnWeekTest` (would fail under the old hardcode) and updated `test_save_espn_cbs_references.py` (one test had pinned `week == 2`).
- **FantasyPros saver hardcoded `FP_CONTENT_DATE = "2026-09-22"`.** Now derives the article date from the puller's fetch log (latest ok entry for the week), fail-closed when absent. 5 regression tests added.
- **ESPN fixture promotion only covered half_12** (the pull is half-PPR only). The other 11 ESPN combos retain prior-week values — the fixture's ESPN section is mixed-vintage until ESPN publishes all scorings. Same for FantasyCalc (12-team only; 8/10/14-team combos retain prior values).
- **Legacy `values` shadowed promoted `reindexed`** on ESPN half_12 (596 stale vs 348 new). Synced `values = reindexed` on the promoted combo; promotion code still needs the regression fix.
- Review verdicts for all five sources came back `hold` (native drift vs Week 2 fixtures, coverage changes) and were manually overridden to `ready` with audit notes after verifying each hold traced to genuine source movement, not corruption. The drift check compares Week 3 candidates against Week 2 fixtures, so fresh data predictably trips it — the review methodology needs a same-vintage comparison, not hand-edits. Tracked as follow-up.
- USA Today reindex now has 9 unanchored players (Stribling, Thornton, Lane, Brooks, Cooper, Williams, Sanders, Dell, Tagovailoa) — they sit in USA Today's Week 3 set but outside ESPN's 348-player Week 3 half-PPR pull (down from 596). Fail-closed to review; tests pin the exact set.

## 2026-09-26 — Mac command-center recovery and dashboard verification

### Verified

- The bundle commit object `1b6af96` was recoverable, but its prerequisite
  parent was not on GitHub main. The recovered patch applied cleanly onto
  `origin/main` after extracting the thin pack and diffing the object against
  the live remote commit. [`git index-pack --fix-thin`, `git apply --index`]
- Supabase production holds Week 3 rows for all five dashboard sources:
  CBS week 3 (355 rows), ESPN week 3 (349 rows, snapshot 2026-09-25),
  FantasyCalc week 3 (591 rows), FantasyPros week 3 (534 rows, content
  2026-09-22), and USA Today week 3 (702 rows, content 2026-09-23).
  [Supabase SQL summary query]
- The recovered comparison artifact contained Week 3 direct-source value
  changes but stale Week 2 metadata/labels (`built_at`, `fetched_at`,
  `week_designated`, hardcoded comparison labels). Repaired the metadata and
  UI labels so the dashboard reports 5 Week 3 rails and source snapshot
  2026-09-25 22:38:27Z. [local JSON inspection + Playwright snapshot]
- `make validate` passed: naming check, reference build, sync, and 367 tests
  OK (6 skipped). [local command]
- The required 12-combo headless curve sweep passed against regenerated `dist/`:
  all 3 scoring modes × 4 league sizes reported `fixedPieIndexed=true`,
  `sourceScaleAgreement=true`, and no chart-health FAIL entries. [Playwright
  run-code over local `dist/`]

### Open

- Week 3 direct rails are current; adjusted source projects remain paused until
  fresh stage-2 adjustment-input fits land. The page now says this explicitly
  rather than rendering stale adjusted curves as if they were current.
- The repo-local Supabase helper path (`~/workspace/skills/supabase-football-signal/bin`)
  is missing on this Mac, so `make supabase-import` cannot run locally yet.
  Supabase verification in this session used the connected Supabase tool
  instead of the repo's `sbclient` path.
